  <p>I am originally from a small mining town called Kriel. I got my Software Development Diploma from TUT
    in Witbank. I did my 6-month practical at a company called Venture Point Consulting Services, which is
    based in Midrand. I mostly did static web site development for them and I just started touching on
    mobile development, before I left for a junior software development position at Gijima for Columbus
    Stainless.
  </p>
  <p>I am very passionate about technology; I am a hard worker and I am very honest. I also pay close
    attention to detail and I own up to my mistakes. My current goal is to constantly improve my skills and 
    to earn a position where I can be a leader of team someday.
